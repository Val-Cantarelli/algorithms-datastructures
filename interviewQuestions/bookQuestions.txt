Book Question 1.5.5 (open-ended)
Estimate the minimum amount of time (in days) that would be required for quick-find to solve
a dynamic connectivity problem with 10^9 sites and 10^6 input pairs, on a computer capable
of executing 10^9 instructions per second. Assume that each iteration of the inner for loop
requires 10 machine instructions.

Total = input pairs x N (sites) x 10(machine instructions) / CPU(10⁹)

Total = 10⁶ * (10⁹ * 10) / 10⁹ = 10⁷/ 60 * 60 * 24
Toal = 115 days
