1. Given that the Union Find algorithm is designed to manage dynamic connectivity issues effectively,
can you explain how you would implement the Quick Union and Quick Find algorithms to manage a network
of objects? Please describe the main differences between these two algorithms in terms of efficiency
and scalability, and discuss any potential improvements or applications of these algorithms in
real-world scenarios. Additionally, illustrate how you would approach optimizing these algorithms when
dealing with large datasets where memory and processing speed are significant constraints.
