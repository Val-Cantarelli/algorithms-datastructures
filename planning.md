## Weekly Structure

Mon–Thu: Theory + Practice  
Fri: Complementary Reading  
Sat: Review + Notes  
Sun: Mini Challenge

---

## Week 1 — Deep OOP
- Concepts: Inheritance, composition, polymorphism, encapsulation
- Java: abstract, interface, final, nested classes
- Python: @property, @classmethod, __slots__, composition
- Practice: Build a scheduling hierarchy with calendar, appointments, and notifications

---

## Week 2 — Access Modifiers & Visibility
- Java: public, private, protected, package-private
- Python: _var, __var, introspection
- Practice: Create a BankAccount class with protected attributes and access control logic

---

## Week 3 — Data Structures: Collections & itertools
- Java: List, Set, Map, Deque, Collections
- Python: deque, Counter, defaultdict, groupby, product
- Practice: Group, count, and reorganize a simulated dataset

---

## Week 4 — Reflection & Introspection
- Java: Class, Method, Field, getDeclared...
- Python: getattr, setattr, type, inspect, metaclasses
- Practice: Create an object serialization system using introspection

---

## Week 5 — Streams & Functional Programming
- Java: Stream, filter, map, reduce, collect
- Python: map, filter, reduce, generators, comprehensions
- Practice: Analyze a sales dataset: total per client, top products, average values

---

## Week 6 — Lambdas, Decorators & Higher-Order Functions
- Java: Predicate, Function, Consumer, method references
- Python: lambda, @decorator, functools.wraps, partial
- Practice: Build a dynamic validation system using pluggable functions

---

## Week 7 — Concurrency & Async
- Java: Thread, ExecutorService, synchronized, CompletableFuture
- Python: threading, asyncio, await, multiprocessing
- Practice: Download files or process data in parallel

---

## Week 8 — Exceptions & Robustness
- Java: try, catch, throws, checked vs unchecked exceptions
- Python: try, except, finally, custom exceptions
- Practice: Build an API that returns friendly error messages

---

## Week 9 — Packaging, Imports & Execution
- Java: package, JAR, main(String[] args)
- Python: __main__, __init__.py, sys.path, virtualenv, Poetry
- Practice: Create a reusable package with setup in both languages

---

## Week 10 — Testing, Profiling & Code Quality
- Java: JUnit, Mockito, Maven, SonarQube
- Python: pytest, unittest, mock, coverage, cProfile
- Practice: Test a function using mock, measure performance, cover error handling
